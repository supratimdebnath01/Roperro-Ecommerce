              <p>4.8.9.. if the User in any way breaches the Cancellation, Return and Refund Policy</p>
              <p>4.9. In the event a User returns a Product that is not accompanied by the accessories, gifts or other items originally bundled with such Product, ROPERRO shall have the right, exercisable at its sole discretion, to (i) (a) refuse to accept the return of such Product, or (b) process any refund thereof, or (ii) deduct the amount payable in respect of such items from the amount of refund such User is entitled to.</p>
              <p>4.10.

              <p>4.11. It is expressly clarified that the refund entitled to by a User shall not include monies paid towards shipping charges or any other such charges applicable from time to time, except in case of a Product having a defect at the time of delivery (for reasons attributable to, and accepted by ROPERRO after due verification at its sole discretion). </p>
              <p>4.12. ROPERRO shall make all reasonable attempts to keep the User apprised of the status of refund through updates shared on the User’s registered mobile number and email address. ROPERRO disclaims all liabilities that may arise on account of its failure to keep the User apprised of the status of the refund.</p>
              <p>4.13. If the request for refund is undisputed by ROPERRO, the refund should reflect in the User’s bank account /card and/or the User’s ROPERRO Wallet within such reasonable time (subject to the policies of the User’s bank in case of bank account/credit card refunds) from the date on which ROPERRO initiates the refund.</p>
              <p>4.14. Refunds shall be processed by ROPERRO through its normal banking channels except in cases where a User had utilised his/her ROPERRO Wallet for purchase of Products or opted for the cash on delivery option. Where a User had utilised his/her ROPERRO Wallet for payment towards the purchased Products, ROPERRO shall process all refunds only into such User’s ROPERRO Wallet. Where a User had opted for cash on delivery option for payment towards the purchased Products, ROPERRO shall process all refunds into either the User’s ROPERRO Wallet or the Users’ valid bank accounts, if details of such accounts are provided by the User to ROPERRO at the time of refund. Further, should the User have used more than 1 (one) payment option for the purchase of Products on the Platforms, ROPERRO shall process all refunds through a Payment Option (as defined in the Fees and Payments Policy) ROPERRO deems fit, in its sole discretion, to process such refunds. Once the amount is refunded into a User’s ROPERRO Wallet, it cannot be further transferred to any other bank account or encashed, and would continue to remain in the User’s ROPERRO Wallet until exhausted for shopping on the Platforms. For the purpose of illustration, if a User purchases a Product worth INR 1,000 (Indian Rupees One thousand) and pays INR 500 (Indian Rupees Five hundred) for the purchase of such Product using balances in his/her ROPERRO Wallet, and the remaining INR 500 through his credit card, and such amount is to be refunded pursuant to the refund criteria set out under this Cancellation, Return and Refund Policy being met, then ROPERRO may choose to refund, at its sole discretion, INR 500 (Indian Rupees Five hundred) to such User’s ROPERRO Wallet and the remaining INR 500 (Indian Rupees Five hundred) to the User’s credit card source account, or both the amounts only to such User’s ROPERRO Wallet.</p>
              <p>4.15. Return of purchased Products are facilitated through ROPERRO’s reverse-logistics partners. Upon a User making a request for return of Product on the Platforms and the same being duly acknowledged by ROPERRO, ROPERRO’s reverse-logistics partners shall get in touch with the User in order to collect the purchased Products from the User and delivering it to ROPERRO. While ROPERRO has made reasonable endeavours to ensure delivery and pick-ups across multiple locations in India, currently, ROPERRO has a select list of areas where deliveries and collection can be undertaken by its reverse-logistics partners. In events where ROPERRO is unable to facilitate a pick-up of the purchased Product for return from the User, the User is required to self-ship the Product to ROPERRO’s shipping warehouse, the address for which will be intimated to the User upon the User placing such request for return.. Upon self-shipping the Product to ROPERRO’s warehouse, the User shall be required to scan the courier/postal receipt to <u>customercare@roperro.com</u> for ROPERRO’s records. The aforesaid return by self-shipping the Products is subject to the returned Products passing quality check at ROPERRO’s returns desk/warehouse.</p>
              <p>4.16. In the event where the User claims to have self-shipped the Product in accordance with the process set out above and ROPERRO does not receive the returned Product or the package containing such Product is empty, the User shall be required to submit the ‘proof of delivery’ received from the courier/postal agency to ROPERRO to prove his/her claim of return of Products through self-shipment to ROPERRO. It is specifically clarified that any refunds shall be processed by ROPERRO only upon it receiving the returned Products and concluding required quality checks or receiving the ‘proof of delivery’ from the User, as the case may be.</p>
